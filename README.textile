h1. jQTouch extension to recognize multi-touch gestures.

More detail on built-in event handling in Mobile Safari can be found "here":http://bit.ly/9r80PW

Usage example:

<pre>
var actions = {
	onGestureStart: function(scale, rotation, event){
		// do stuff when the event started
	},
	// don't forget the come after object properties and methods
	onGestureChange: function(scale, rotation, e){
		// do some more stuff when fingers move
	},
	onGestureEnd: function(s,r,e){ 
		// called when the fat lady sang... or the gesture is done.
	}
};
$('.my_selector').bindGestures(actions);
</pre>


The parameters that the callback functions receive are:

*scale* - amount scaled since the gesture started  
*rotation* - amount of rotation. The angle is in degrees, where clockwise is positive and counterclockwise is negative.
*event* - jQuery event that's triggered. To acces the original event use *event.originalEvent*. You can also access the element that has been touched with *event.originalEvent.target*
